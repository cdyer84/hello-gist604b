# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Chris Dyer  
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to structure a repository using folders and Markdown
- How GitHub Issues and labels drive collaboration and planning
- Why licenses and READMEs matter for open source reuse

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Creating folders in GitHubâ€™s UI:** I created folders by specifying the path (`docs/learning-log.md`) when adding a file.  
- **Two-repository workflow:** Linking the Classroom repo to my public work repo via `repo.txt` showed how the autograder finds and tests my work.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills help me build a public portfolio, collaborate with teams, and contribute to open source GIS tools. Clear documentation and issues mirror how real GIS projects are managed.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating `hello-gist604b` mirrors contributing to larger projects: clear docs, issues, licensing, and a working script that others can run and extend.
